An analysis on Boolean Implications on mRNA/proteins from Breast Cancer subtypes: is there an evidence a certain quantity of mRNA/proteins and another, in case of a given Breast Cancer subtype?
## Tools
This analysis has been conducted using *R*, Breast Cancer dataset was given by Professor Giovanni Micale.
Original dataset has been cleaned and diveded into subtypes, then [StepMiner](https://github.com/suryattheja/StepMiner-BioInformatics) and [BooleanNet](https://github.com/ialbert/booleannet) are applied in order to give implication.
Then, using *igrap* library, implication are displayed.
